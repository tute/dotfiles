# On rspec files:

- Don't use `let` or `before` blocks, use the setup/execute/expect phases, even if it results in repeated code. You may extract common setup into methods at the bottom of the spec file.
- Don't stub the system under test
- Try not to use doubles, stubs or mocks. If it gets too verbose or dependencies get complicated, suggest to refactor the class to be tested.
- Don't use `when` in `context "when` (`when` is redundant)
- Add contexts for the different variations/sections
- Don't add code comments for the setup/execute/expect phases, just separate them with new lines
- After generating the spec file, try to run it and fix the first round of errors
